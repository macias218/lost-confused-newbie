  <p> About Us:</p>
  <p> Established in 2014 when Melissa moved to a new State, and missed the local diners she grew up with.
    Initially, her desire was purely personal as she really wanted a local diner in her area.
    Once she realized how many people in the area wanted a locally owned diner, she jumped at her chance to make it happen.
    Using recipes she learned from her mother, grandmother and friends; Melissa has brought the comfort of home to all those who visit.
